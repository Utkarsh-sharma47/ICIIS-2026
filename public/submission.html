<p>
Prospective authors are invited to submit original, high-quality, and unpublished research papers to the 2026 IEEE 20th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS 2026).

Any paper found violating this policy will be rejected without review.

Papers not compliant with the IEEE template including appropriate referencing or exceeding the page limit will be returned without review. Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere will be considered. The paper must clearly indicate the research area, main results, and contributions.
